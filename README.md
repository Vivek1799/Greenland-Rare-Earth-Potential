# Greenland Rare Earth Potential

The project focuses on visually explaining the rare earth mining landscape in Greenland. The arctic region is going through significant changes due to climate change, and mining companies see an opportunity to exploit the critical minerals trapped beneath its unexplored surface. 

Being the largest island on earth with a population of just 56,000 people, Greenland has the potential to become a major supplier of critical minerals needed for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies. However, responsible development of the mining sector that considers environmental, social and geopolitical implications will be key to realizing this opportunity in a sustainable way.

I came across a paper, titled ‘Global rare earth elements projects: New developments and supply chains’, published by Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Geological Survey of Finland, and Minmetals Rare Earth Group. They had compiled a detailed database of all the active rare earth mines in the world, and evaluated them based on the mine’s resource value. What caught my attention was that Greenland was listed separately from the other continents and just two mines alone in the island could contribute to 22% of the global supply. 

After studying the data briefly, I started researching rare earths and the mining industry in Greenland. The media coverage on Greenland was largely about melting glaciers, and some of them focused on the controversial Kvanefjeld mine. My idea for the story was to understand the geography, map the rare earth mines and put a broader perspective on the rare earth industry in Greenland. China controls the majority of the supply chain in the rare earths. The west seeks to break the monopoly and build its own supply chain. But wealthier countries have always tried to dominate smaller states to exploit its resources and use them to secure strategic mineral resources.
